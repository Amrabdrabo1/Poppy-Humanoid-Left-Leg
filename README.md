# Poppy-Humanoid-Left-Leg

The main goal of a project is to design and implement a human similar controlled machine which fulfills tasks done by the people. The first step to make such a robot is to let him move in a specific path which is given by the user and this is actually the main goal of the course. To start implementing this process at the beginning we have to design the left leg of the Poppy Humanoid on solid works to calculate the exact values needed to buy the suitable motors and to 3 D print the parts. It was very important to calculate the inverse and forward kinematics to make the desired trajectories given by the user on Matlab. After finalizing the design, the robot motion is tested using Simscape to make sure that all the values are suitable before any wiring. Last but not least we bought all the hardware components needed to build the left leg of the robot.
